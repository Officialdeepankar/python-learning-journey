# ðŸ§  Concept: Operators in Python
# Python supports different kinds of operators:

# âž• 1. Arithmetic Operators
# Used for basic math operations.


# Operator	    Description	    Example (a = 10, b = 3)	   Result
# +	             Addition	          a + b	                13
# -             Subtraction	           a - b                 7
# *	          Multiplication	        a * b	             30
# /	               Division           	a / b	              3.33
# //	        Floor Division          a // b           	   3
# %         	Modulus (remainder)	    a % b	                1
# **          	Exponentiation         	a ** b	                 1000


x = 5        # assigns 5 to x
x += 2       # same as x = x + 2 â†’ now x is 7
x *= 3       # x = x * 3 â†’ now x is 21

#Comparision operator 

# Operator | Meaning | Example (a = 5, b = 3) | Result
# == | Equal to | a == b | False
# != | Not equal to | a != b | True
# > | Greater than | a > b | True
# < | Less than | a < b | False
# >= | Greater or equal | a >= b | True
# <= | Less or equal | a <= b | False



#logical opeartors

# Operator | Description | Example | Result
# and | True if both are True | a > 2 and b < 5 | True
# or | True if one is True | a > 10 or b < 5 | True
# not | Reverses condition | not (a < 10) | False
