#ðŸ”¹ Problem 1: First 3 Characters

text = "Programming"
# Get the first 3 characters using slicing
# Expected Output: "Pro"


#print(text[0:3])


#ðŸ”¹ Problem 2: Last 4 Characters
text = "Technology"
# Slice and print the last 4 characters
# Expected Output: "logy"

# print(len(text))
# print(text[5:11])


#ðŸ”¹ Problem 3: Reverse the String


text = "Python"
# Use slicing to reverse the string
# Expected Output: "nohtyP"

# print(text[::-1])


text = "ABCDEFGHIJ"
# Use slicing to get every second character
# Expected Output: "ACEGI"


#print(text[::2])

text = "Extraordinary"
# Slice to remove the first and last characters
# Expected Output: "xtraordinar"

#print(text[1:12])

text = "ABCDEFGHIJ"
# First, reverse the string, then get every 2nd character from it
# Expected Output: "JHFDB"

# text2=text[::-1]
# print(text2[::2])

text = "1234567890abcdef"
# Start at index 1 and pick every 3rd character
# Expected Output: "258ad"
#print(text[1::3])
