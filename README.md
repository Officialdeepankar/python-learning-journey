# 🐍 Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Python Learning Journey**!  
This repository is my personal space to learn, explore, and grow with Python — from the basics to more advanced topics, libraries, and real-world projects.

---

## 📁 What's Inside

The repo is structured into multiple folders based on topics or learning paths. Here's a general idea of how it's organized:

- `00_basics/` — Python fundamentals (variables, data types, loops, functions, etc.)
- `01_oop/` — Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance, etc.)
- `02_advanced_python/` — Advanced topics like decorators, generators, etc.
- `03_libraries/` — Explorations of libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- `04_projects/` — Mini projects to apply what I've learned
- `05_dsa/` — Data Structures & Algorithms with Python
- `06_interview_prep/` — Common coding questions & patterns
- `07_web_dev/` — Python web development with Flask & APIs

> 📌 **Note:** Not all folders or topics are complete yet — this is a growing journey.  
> As I continue to learn, I’ll keep updating this repo with new content, examples, and projects.

## 🌱 Why This Repo?

I'm building this as a long-term, structured guide to:
- Practice daily
- Track my progress
- Build a personal reference library
- Eventually help others who are also learning Python

---

## 🚀 Goals Ahead

In the future, I plan to explore:
- Machine Learning & AI (likely in a separate repo)
- Real-world apps with Python + Web frameworks
- More DSA & system design prep

Thanks for checking out my learning path — feel free to star or follow if you’re on a similar journey!

Happy coding! 😊
